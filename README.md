My portfolio repository on GitHub

Welcome to my portfolio GitHub repository.

In this project, I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to create 5 different webpages that are linked.

Here is a link to my live site: https://upbeat-engelbart-2688b5.netlify.app/

To complete this project, I took the following steps:

1. Lay out and link all of the HTML that I needed.
2. Add the JS/jQuery that created the accordion and carousel interactivity
3. Add initial CSS
5. Add a media query to allow for a responsive navbar.
6. Finalize CSS to correct positioning and color scheme
7. Update this readMe to ensure all steps were met.


Here are a list of unsolved problems I faced while creating this project.
