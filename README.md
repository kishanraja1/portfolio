Welcome to my portfolio GitHub repository.

In this project, I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to create 5 different webpages that are linked.

Here is a link to my live site: https://upbeat-engelbart-2688b5.netlify.app/

To complete this project, I took the following steps:

1. Lay out and link all of the HTML that I needed.
2. Add the JS/jQuery that created the accordion and carousel interactivity
3. Add initial CSS.
4. Create the collapsed navbar and media query to allow for a responsive navbar.
6. Finalize CSS to correct positioning and color scheme.
7. Comment through the code.
8. Update this readMe to ensure all steps were met.


Here are a list of unsolved problems I faced while creating this project:

1. On the resume page, the footer needs to toggle between sticky and absolute based on if all three divs are fully expanded.
2. The carousel is fully responsive until less than 300 px. In this case the text under the img comes out of the container.
